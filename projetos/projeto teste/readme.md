projeto teste usando branches. 

## Referência sobre modos de colaboração em projetos de software:
https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-collaborative-development-models.
(Nós estamos usando o modelo "_shared repository model_").

> "In the shared repository model, collaborators are granted push access to a single shared repository and topic branches are created when changes need to be made. Pull requests are useful in this model as they initiate code review and general discussion about a set of changes before the changes are merged into the main development branch. This model is more prevalent with small teams and organizations collaborating on private projects."
